# EmptyOverworld Datapack

This datapack transforms Minecraft into a **Nether-Only Survival** experience with working progression to the End.  
Designed for Minecraft **1.21.x** (Fabric/Vanilla-compatible).

---

## ✨ Features

### 🌍 Overworld
- Generates as a **complete void** (no blocks, no terrain).
- Players are **automatically teleported** to the Nether if they enter.
- **Continuous monitoring** ensures no player can stay in the void.
- Can still be entered via Nether portals for building sky-islands if desired.

### 🌋 Nether
- Acts as the **main survival dimension**.
- A **safe spawn hub** is generated at **(0,65,0)**:
  - 6×6 reinforced deepslate platform
- **Welcome advancement** explains the Nether-Only concept to new players.
- **Self-healing system** ensures players always end up in the Nether.
- Respawn rules:
  - Players **without a respawn anchor** are teleported here automatically.
  - Players **with a respawn anchor** respawn at their own anchor as normal.

### 🔮 End Access
- **Nether Ruined Portals are replaced** with **Stronghold End Portal Rooms**.
- Rooms generate ~10 blocks deeper than portals normally would, so Nether terrain naturally encloses them.
- End Portals are unfilled — players must craft and insert Eyes of Ender as in vanilla.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the `EmptyOverworld` datapack (ZIP or folder).
2. Place it in your world save under:
3. Start the world (or run `/reload` if already open).
4. On new worlds, the void Overworld and Nether hub are automatically set up.

## 📜 Notes
- **Respawn Anchors work as expected** — the Nether hub only applies if no personal spawn is set.
- **Players can still travel to the void Overworld** via portals, but will be automatically teleported back.
- **End progression is preserved**:
  - Blaze rods (Nether Fortresses)
  - Ender pearls (Piglins, Endermen)
  - Eyes of Ender for End Portals
- **Self-healing system** automatically restarts if `/schedule clear` is run.
